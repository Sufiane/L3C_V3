# L3C_V3
L3C's back api V3

This will be a simple but powerful API, to propose a movie to watch each week, the most popular ones (on TMDB),
the top rated ones (on TMDB) and of course the one currently playing (in France)

TODO:
    - set up eslint
    - set up redis
    - post selection endpoint
    - L3C selection endpoint (from the list of currently playing)
    - history of selection (redis storage?)
    - redirect/link to messenger bot
    - refactor
