# L3C_V3
L3C's back api V3

This will be a simple but powerful API, to propose a movie to watch each week, the most popular ones (on TMDB),
the top rated ones (on TMDB) and of course the one currently playing (in France)

TODO:
    - add logging system with signal
    - history of selection (redis storage?)
    - L3C selection endpoint (from the list of currently playing)
    - refactor
    - redirect/link to messenger bot (will mostly never happen since fb is blocking the bot publication)
